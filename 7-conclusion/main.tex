\subsection{Future work}

To be able to work with an optrode array with hundreds of channels, the filter implementation needs to be optimised such that hundreds of filter channels can fit in the processing unit.  Alternatively, while our design focus has been for multiple-optrode arrays, the proposed method is equally applicable in systems with few optrodes;  for such systems, filter resource use is of less concern and a more complex filter algorithm with more taps can be designed to achieve the full potential of active noise cancelling~\cite{ANCHeadphone}.
